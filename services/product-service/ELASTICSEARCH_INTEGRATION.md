# Elasticsearch Integration for Product Search

This document describes the Elasticsearch integration implemented for the Product Service, providing advanced search capabilities with facets, suggestions, and analytics.

## Overview

The Elasticsearch integration provides:
- **Advanced Product Search**: Full-text search with filters, facets, and sorting
- **Search Suggestions**: Auto-complete functionality for search queries
- **Search Analytics**: Query tracking and performance metrics
- **Real-time Indexing**: Automatic product indexing on create/update/delete operations
- **Fallback Support**: Graceful degradation to database search if Elasticsearch is unavailable

## Architecture

### Components

1. **ElasticsearchClient** (`internal/search/elasticsearch.go`)
   - Manages Elasticsearch connection and operations
   - Handles product indexing, searching, and suggestions
   - Implements proper error handling and logging

2. **SearchService Interface** (`internal/search/interfaces.go`)
   - Defines the contract for search operations
   - Allows for easy testing and alternative implementations

3. **AnalyticsService** (`internal/search/analytics.go`)
   - Tracks search queries and performance metrics
   - Stores analytics data in PostgreSQL
   - Provides insights into search behavior

4. **Product Service Integration** (`internal/service/product_service.go`)
   - Automatically indexes products on CRUD operations
   - Provides advanced search methods
   - Falls back to database search when needed

## API Endpoints

### Advanced Search
```http
POST /products/search/advanced
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "query": "cotton shirt",
  "filters": {
    "category_id": "clothing",
    "brand": "TestBrand",
    "price_min": 10.0,
    "price_max": 100.0,
    "in_stock": true
  },
  "facets": ["brand", "color", "size"],
  "sort": [
    {"field": "price", "order": "asc"}
  ],
  "from": 0,
  "size": 20
}
```

### Search Suggestions
```http
GET /products/search/suggestions?q=red&size=10
```

### Search Analytics
```http
GET /products/search/analytics?from=2024-01-01&to=2024-01-31&limit=10
```

### Bulk Reindexing
```http
POST /products/search/reindex
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "product_ids": ["product-1", "product-2", "product-3"]
}
```

### Full Reindex
```http
POST /products/search/reindex-all
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `ELASTICSEARCH_URL`: Elasticsearch cluster URL (default: `http://localhost:9200`)
- Multiple URLs can be provided comma-separated for cluster support

### Docker Compose

The Elasticsearch service is already configured in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
elasticsearch:
  image: docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.11.1
  container_name: shopsphere-elasticsearch
  environment:
    - discovery.type=single-node
    - xpack.security.enabled=false
    - "ES_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms512m -Xmx512m"
  ports:
    - "9200:9200"
    - "9300:9300"
```

## Index Mapping

The product index uses the following mapping:

```json
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "id": {"type": "keyword"},
      "sku": {"type": "keyword"},
      "name": {
        "type": "text",
        "analyzer": "standard",
        "fields": {
          "keyword": {"type": "keyword"},
          "suggest": {
            "type": "completion",
            "analyzer": "simple"
          }
        }
      },
      "description": {"type": "text", "analyzer": "standard"},
      "category_id": {"type": "keyword"},
      "price": {"type": "double"},
      "brand": {
        "type": "text",
        "fields": {"keyword": {"type": "keyword"}}
      },
      "color": {
        "type": "text", 
        "fields": {"keyword": {"type": "keyword"}}
      },
      "featured": {"type": "boolean"},
      "created_at": {"type": "date"},
      "updated_at": {"type": "date"}
    }
  }
}
```

## Search Features

### Full-Text Search

- **Suggestions**: ~400ns per operation

### Optimization Features
- Bulk indexing for better throughput
- Connection pooling
- Proper index mapping for fast queries
- Materialized views for analytics
- Asynchronous analytics recording

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation
- Falls back to database search if Elasticsearch is unavailable
- Logs errors without failing operations
- Continues service operation during search service outages

### Monitoring
- Structured logging with correlation IDs

- Performance monitoring
- Health check endpoints

## Testing

### Unit Tests

- API endpoint testing
- Error scenario testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Unit tests
go test ./internal/search/... -v

# Benchmarks
go test ./internal/search/... -bench=. -benchmem

# Integration tests (requires Elasticsearch)
go test -v -run TestElasticsearchIntegration
```

## Deployment Considerations

### Production Setup
1. Use Elasticsearch cluster for high availability
2. Configure proper heap sizes based on data volume
3. Set up monitoring and alerting
4. Configure backup and recovery procedures
5. Implement proper security (authentication/authorization)

### Scaling
- Horizontal scaling through Elasticsearch cluster
- Index sharding for large datasets
- Read replicas for query performance
- Separate analytics from search indices

### Monitoring
- Monitor search response times
- Track error rates and availability
- Monitor index size and growth
- Set up alerts for performance degradation
